# Numerical Solution Math Problem
Saw a [video](https://youtu.be/SE700Lc_9pE) discussing how to solve an Olympiad math problem, namely,

$$3^{m} - 2^m = 65.$$

It took many different tricks and techniques to solve, but the problem could be quickly solved using a roots-finding numerical method. This project uses the bisection method to solve the problem.
